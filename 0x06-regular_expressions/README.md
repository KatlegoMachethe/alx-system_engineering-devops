# Regular Expressions (regex)

In this task we build reular expressions using Oniguruma which is a regular expression library in Ruby.

Since this task is just the introduction to regex, we use the code below provided in the ALX SE task [0x06. Regular expression](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/projects/78#quiz-completed)
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts ARGV[0].scan(/127.0.0.[0-9]/).join
```
and just replace the regex part (code in between the `//`).
