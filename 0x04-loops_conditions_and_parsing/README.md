# 0x04-loops\_conditions\_and\_parsing

The learning objective of this task is to know hot to use loops and conditional statements in shell. This is part of the ALX SE programme curriculum: [0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/projects/251)

## File names and purpose
1. `0-RSA_public_key.pub` has my SSH RSA key pair
2. `1-for_best_school` is a bash script that writes "Best School" 10 times with for loop.
3. `2-while_best_school` is a bash script that writes "Best School" 10 times with while loop.
4. `3-until_best_school` is a bash script that writes "Best School" 10 times with until loop.
5. `4-if_9_say_hi` is a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times, but for the 9th iteration, displays "Best School" and then "Hi" on a new line.
6. `5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance` is a bash script that loops from 1 to 10 and displays "bad luck" and "good luck" on the 4th and 8th iterations respectively and "Best School" on other iterations.
